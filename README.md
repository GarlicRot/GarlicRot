[![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/GarlicRot/rusherhack-instance-info/total)](https://github.com/GarlicRot/rusherhack-instance-info/releases/download/v1.3/instance-info-1.3.jar)

**rusherhack-instance-info** is a RusherHack plugin originally designed to enhance the Minecraft window title by displaying useful information such as your account name, the server you're connected to, and your Minecraft skin as the window icon. This fork not only retains these original functionalities but also introduces several new customization options to give you even greater control over the information displayed.

- **Custom Account Name**: Now, you can set a custom account name to appear in the window title instead of your actual account name. This feature allows for greater privacy or personalization, with the default name set to "Notch".

- **Custom Server Name**: Added the ability to replace the actual server IP in the window title with a custom server name. This is particularly useful for keeping server details private or for adding a personal touch. The default custom server name is "oldfag.org".

- **Custom Status Messages**: You can now fully customize the messages displayed when you are not connected to a server or when you are in singleplayer mode. This enhancement allows you to replace the standard "Not Connected" and "Singleplayer" texts with messages that better suit your preferences.
